## A brief history of Piano & Cristofori
The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Italy. Cristofori was unsatisfied by the lack of control that musicians had over the volume 
level of the harpsichord. He is credited for switching out the plucking mechanism with a hammer to create the modern piano in around the year 1700.

The instrument was actually first named "clavicembalo col piano e forte" (literally, a harpsichord that can play soft and loud noises). 
This was shortened to the now common name: "Piano".
